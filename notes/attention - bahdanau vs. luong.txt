Bahdanau Attention:


1. Produce encoder hidden states
2. Calc alignment scores between previous decoder hidden state and each of the encoder hidden states. (last encoder hidden state = first decoder hidden state)
3. Softmax alignment scores - alignment scores for each encoder hidden state are combined in single vector and then softmaxed
4. Calc context vector - encoder hidden states and their alignment scores are multiplied to form the context vector
5. Decode output - context vector is concatenated with previous decoder output and fed into the decoder with previous decoder hidden state to produce new output
6. Repeat 2. - 5. until end of sequence

Luong Attention:

1. Produce encoder hidden states
2. Decode - previous decoder hidden state and decoder output is passed to the decoder to generate new hidden state for that time step
3. Calc alignment scores between new decoder hidden state and the encoder hidden states
4. Softmax alignment scores - alignment scores for each encoder hidden state are combined single vector and then softmaxed
5. Calc context vector - encoder hidden states and their alignment scores are multiplied to form the context vector
6. Produce final output - context vector is concatenated with decoder hidden state (from 2.) and passed through fully connected layer to produce new output
7. Repeat 2. - 5. until end of sequence
